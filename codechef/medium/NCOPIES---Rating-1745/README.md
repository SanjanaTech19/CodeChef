## Problem

### Copy and Paste

Chef has binary string $A$ of length $N$. He constructs a new binary string $B$ by concatenating $M$ copies of $A$ together. For example, if $A = \texttt{"10010"}$, $M = 3$, then $B = \texttt{"100101001010010"}$.

Chef calls an index $i$ $(1 \le i \le N \cdot M)$  *good*  if:

- $pref_i = suf_{i + 1}$.

Here, $pref_j = B_1 + B_2 + \ldots + B_j$ and $suf_j = B_{j} + B_{j + 1} + \ldots + B_{N \cdot M}$ (Note that $suf_{N \cdot M + 1} = 0$ by definition)

Chef wants to find the number of good indices in $B$. Can you help him do so?

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$ — the length of the binary string $A$ and the number of times $A$ is concatenated to form $B$.
- The second line of each test case contains a binary string $A$ of length $N$ containing $0$s and $1$s only.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of good indices in $B$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
- $A$ is a binary string, i.e, contains only the characters $0$ and $1$.
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.
- The sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
2 2
00
2 4
11
3 3
101

```

```
4
1
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  $B = \texttt{"0000"}$. In this string, all the indices are good.

 **Test case $2$:**  $B = \texttt{"11111111"}$. In this string, only $i = 4$ is good.

 **Test case $3$:**  $B = \texttt{"101101101"}$. In this string, $i = 4$ and $i = 5$ are good.

```py
# cook your dish here
t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    n,m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    
    total_ones = a.count('1') * m
    
    if total_ones % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
    elif total_ones == 0:
        print(n * m)
        
    else:
        target = total_ones // 2
        
        count = 0
        current_ones = 0
        
        for i in range(2*n):
            if a[i % n] == '1':
                current_ones += 1
            
            # If the left side has reached our target, this is a "good spot"!
            if current_ones == target:
                count += 1
                
        print(count)
    
    
    
```
